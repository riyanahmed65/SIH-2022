# aadhaar_auth
The Above code is in development stage(WIP) , fell free to help in development by createing a PR with fixes.

#overview:
to create a website/extension to solve problem of students using fake identity, enrolment, duplication and authentication of students.

#problem statement
Every year huge number of students take admissions into college. With the current covid crisis ongoing, almost all the process have become online. Even classes have become online. It was observed that there were students who did fake enrollments while filling forms of a college for exams, online classes or similar purposes. Also online mischief was done by many students thus disturbing the whole class. Same happens with online exams happening with google forms. Since making fake Gmail id is not a big deal for kids of todayâ€™s generation hence often fake entries were found which caused lots of issues to teachers evaluating the answers. Hence we need to keep a Aadhar based authentication for students for filling up forms, giving examination or attending online classes. Addressing this problem will ensure only students authenticated with their Aadhar are only permitted to fill forms, attend online classes and give exams thus ensuring the tracking of students. Due to this only genuine entries will be there and any mischief done will be caught easily
